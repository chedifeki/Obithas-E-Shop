# Obithas-E-Shop
An exploration of Dark themed E-shops with a fantasy Twist ! 
### Welcome Visitor!
This website is a study of Dark Themed E-shops
It is done by Chedi Feki for a Web Developement Course<br>

---

Concepts applied:
* HTML5 document structure
* CSS3 and Bootstrap integration for responsiveness
* vanilla JavaScript and basic DOM manipulations  


---

While the above mentioned concepts are applied seriously,
I saw an opportunity in giving it a... Fantasy twist!

The site revolves around the Obitha character, a fearsome persona from the Tunisian Folklore and explores the possibility of her owning an E-commerce.
All the content and Imagery of this site follows that theme and is therefore, just a big joke. 

---

I, Chedi Feki, hereby affirm that I in no way endorse or encourage or promote the use of Magic, Child Mutilations or any abusive behaviors those characters are known for
This is just fiction, please take it with a light heart.

#### This is still a Work in Progress!
